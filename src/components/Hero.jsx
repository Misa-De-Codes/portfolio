                    Hey there, I'm Cloud :] I'm a 16 year old
                    system programmer and backend engineer based in India. I’ve taken coding seriously since 2022, and have been making static website since 2020. Recently, however, I’ve grown a knack for programming. I like contributing to open source as a web developer, which is probably the reason why you've ended up here. Currently struggling with Elixir and Rust.
